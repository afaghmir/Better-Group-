#Definition of Done
Each step of the project prior to being pushed to the main branch must meet these criteriaâ€™s:
- Any added features or bug fixes must pass all testing, syntax checks, acceptance criteria requirements, and meet the standard.
- Features must be manually tested and checked for the usability and accessibility from different environments by the developers and verified by the product owner. 
- Documentation must be provided with every new feature, update, and modifications.
- Before pushing the code to the main branch, a pull and merge requests must be created, and any changes made to the code must be reviewed.
- After the review code must be merged and a appropriate version must be specified in the commit as well as a quick comment of what has been done. 
- Deadlines for each sprint or commit must be discussed in advance and work must be appropriately pushed to the GitHub with respect to the given deadline.
- Requests for any alternative deadlines must be approved with the Product Owner.
