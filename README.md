Project 4THEBETTER



⸻


This project addresses a common issue in the fitness industry. Most of the time, clients are forced to adjust their schedules to attend classes that may not align with their availability. 4THEBETTER allows clients to create the demand, while gym owners and trainers provide the supply. For example, if someone wants to attend a Pilates session from 11:30 to 12:30 during their break between classes, there often isn’t a session available at that time. With this system, if a business sees that there is demand for that time slot, they can assign a trainer and post the session as an option, attracting others who may also want to join.

Solution
A scheduling software that generates its own demand by allowing clients to create availability requests. This enables gyms and trainers to offer sessions that directly match client needs.

⸻
Sorting algorithms (using Python) to create classes and assign optimal locations and times that suit the majority of participants.
